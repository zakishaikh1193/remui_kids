## How to Use

### For Students:
1. Log in to the student dashboard
2. Click "My Courses" in the sidebar or "View All Courses" button
3. Browse courses filtered for their grade level
4. Click "Continue Learning" or "Start Course" to access course content

### For Administrators:
1. Ensure students are enrolled in appropriate courses
2. Use grade-specific course naming conventions:
   - Grade 1: Include "Grade 1", "G1", "First Grade", "Elementary Grade 1", "Beginner", "Foundation", or "Level 1"
   - Grade 2: Include "Grade 2", "G2", "Second Grade", "Elementary Grade 2", "Intermediate", or "Level 2"
   - Grade 3: Include "Grade 3", "G3", "Third Grade", "Elementary Grade 3", "Advanced", or "Level 3"
3. Organize courses in appropriate categories (Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Elementary, etc.)

## Course Filtering Logic

The system filters courses based on:

1. **Course Name Patterns**: Searches course fullname for grade-specific keywords
2. **Course Summary**: Searches course description for grade-specific keywords
3. **Course Categories**: Matches course category names to grade levels
4. **Fallback**: If no grade-specific courses found, shows all enrolled courses

## Grade Detection

Student grade level is determined by:
1. **Primary**: User profile custom field named "grade"
2. **Fallback**: Cohort membership containing grade keywords
3. **Default**: Grade 1 if no grade information found

## Styling

The page uses:
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Card-based layout for courses
- Progress bars with smooth animations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Kid-friendly colors and typography

## Technical Requirements

- Moodle 3.9+ with IOMAD
- remui_kids theme
- PHP 7.4+
- Student role with course enrollment

## Troubleshooting

### No Courses Showing:
1. Check if student is enrolled in courses
2. Verify course naming follows grade conventions
3. Ensure courses are visible and active
4. Check user's grade level detection

### Navigation Issues:
1. Verify file permissions
2. Check URL paths in dashboard template
3. Ensure theme files are properly uploaded

### Styling Problems:
1. Clear Moodle cache
2. Check CSS conflicts with other themes
3. Verify template syntax in Mustache files

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Course search functionality
2. Favorite courses marking
3. Course completion certificates
4. Parent/guardian access
5. Course recommendations based on progress
6. Gamification elements (badges, points)
