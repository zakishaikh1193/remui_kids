## Access Control

All pages implement strict access control:

1. **Login Required**: User must be authenticated
2. **Role Check**: User must be a Department Manager (`managertype = 2`)
3. **Department Assignment**: User must belong to a valid department
4. **Error Handling**: Proper Moodle exceptions for unauthorized access

### Database Verification

Each page checks:
```php
$company_user = $DB->get_record('company_users', ['userid' => $USER->id]);

if (!$company_user || $company_user->managertype != 2) {
    throw new moodle_exception('nopermissions', 'error', '...');
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### AJAX Pattern

All pages use consistent AJAX pattern:

```php
if (isset($_GET['action'])) {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    
    switch ($_GET['action']) {
        case 'action_name':
            try {
                // Process request
                echo json_encode(['status' => 'success', 'data' => $data]);
            } catch (Exception $e) {
                echo json_encode(['status' => 'error', 'message' => $e->getMessage()]);
            }
            exit;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Pattern

All pages use vanilla JavaScript with:
- Document ready events
- Fetch API for AJAX calls
- Dynamic rendering functions
- Pagination management
- Search/filter functionality

### SQL Queries

All queries use:
- Parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- Proper JOIN syntax
- Department filtering
- Performance optimizations (LIMIT, indexes)

---

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**: Moodle session management
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries
4. **XSS Protection**: Moodle output functions
5. **CSRF Protection**: Moodle session tokens
6. **Data Validation**: Input sanitization

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: All lists support pagination to reduce data load
2. **Lazy Loading**: Charts and tables load via AJAX
3. **Database Indexing**: Queries optimized for indexed columns
4. **Caching**: Leverage Moodle's caching system
5. **Asset Loading**: External assets (Chart.js) loaded from CDN

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and compatible with:
- âœ… Chrome (latest)
- âœ… Firefox (latest)
- âœ… Safari (latest)
- âœ… Edge (latest)
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

---
